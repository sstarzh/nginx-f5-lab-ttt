Module 1 - Setup Gitlab 
=======================

In this first module, we will create a new repo on *GitLab*.

This repository will not contain much. It is mostly to see how it is done and give you 
a first experience. 

We will do the following: 

* Create a new repository
* Access the repository via a terminal and run some *git* commands to update the content of 
  our repo
* Merge different "versions" of our *repo*
