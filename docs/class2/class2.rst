**********************************
Class 2 - Setup our first pipeline
**********************************

With Class1, we have reviewed an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) setup.  

In this class, we will setup a basic pipeline with *GitLab* and *Jenkins*.

* Gitlab: It will host our project
* Jenkins: it will be our CI Server. We will use Jenkins to retrieve the *GitLab* repo every time a change happen in it.
