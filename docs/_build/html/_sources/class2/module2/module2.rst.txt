Module 2 - Setup Jenkins
========================

In this second module, we will create our first pipeline in *Jenkins*.

With this pipeline, we will do the following: 

* Create a pipeline that automatically retrieves our *Gitlab* repository
* Browse and list the retrieved repository
* Update our *Gitlab* repo with a *WebHook* so that our pipeline is triggered automatically
  when an update is done.
